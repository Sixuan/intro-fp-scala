NY-Scala - August (Un)meetup  Mon, Aug 29
   
In this beginner talk, I will review some of the rationale, as well as talk a little more 
about the power of functions as a primary unit of computation. I'll also show how first class 
functions allow for computational abstractions that lead to expressive and more correct code.
I'll also introduce function composition, our most powerful technique for constructing programs
from functions. 

Acknowledgments: I've borrowed heavily from Emily Chen from Meetup as well as "FP in Scala" by Runar & Paul
