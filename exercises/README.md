NY-Scala - August (Un)meetup  Mon, Aug 29
   
In this beginner talk, I will review some of the rationale, as well as talk a little more 
about the power of functions as a primary unit of computation. I'll also show how first class 
functions allow for computational abstractioProblems$ns that lead to expressive and more correct code.
